## Description
A Python-based manager for handling vulnerabilities in a penetration testing context. This tool allows users to add, remove, list, and update the status of vulnerabilities through a command-line interface.

## Features
- **Add Vulnerability:** Add a new vulnerability to the manager with details such as ID, name, severity, and description.
- **Remove Vulnerability:** Remove an existing vulnerability from the manager by its ID.
- **List Vulnerabilities:** Display all vulnerabilities currently managed.
- **Update Vulnerability Status:** Change the status of an existing vulnerability.

## Installation

## Future Enhancements

### 1. **Automated Vulnerability Scanning Integration**
   - **Description**: Integrate an automated vulnerability scanning tool like `Nmap`, `Nikto`, or `OWASP ZAP`. The tool would automatically scan specified targets (e.g., IP addresses, URLs) and identify potential vulnerabilities. Detected vulnerabilities would be automatically added to the `VulnerabilityManager` with relevant details such as severity and description.
   - **Benefit**: This enhancement would streamline the process of identifying and managing vulnerabilities by reducing the need for manual input and increasing efficiency in vulnerability detection.

### 2. **Prioritization and Risk Assessment Module**
   - **Description**: Implement a module that assesses and prioritizes vulnerabilities based on their severity, potential impact, and exploitability. The system would assign a risk score to each vulnerability and recommend a prioritized remediation plan.
   - **Benefit**: This enhancement would help cybersecurity professionals focus on the most critical vulnerabilities first, reducing the overall risk to the system or network being managed.

### 3. **Real-Time Threat Intelligence Integration**
   - **Description**: Integrate a threat intelligence feed that provides real-time data on emerging threats and vulnerabilities. The `VulnerabilityManager` would automatically cross-reference existing vulnerabilities against the latest threat intelligence to identify any newly discovered exploits or attack vectors.
   - **Benefit**: By integrating real-time threat intelligence, this enhancement would ensure that the vulnerability management process is always up-to-date, enabling quicker responses to new and evolving threats.
